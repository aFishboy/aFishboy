# Hi, I'm Sam! 👋

I am a senior computer science major at UC Davis with a passion for software engineering and games. Here's a bit about me:

- 💻 Strong academic background in computer science
- 🚀 Over three years of project experience in back-end development
- 🌐 Currently teaching myself front-end development
- 🔧 Proficient in Java, C/C++, and Python
- 🌐 Knowledgeable in computer architecture, networks, databases, and operating systems
- 🤓 Eager to keep learning new technologies

After I graduate in June 2024, I plan to move to Livermore, California, and pursue a challenging full-stack software engineering role. I'm excited about creating and contributing to industry-leading products!
